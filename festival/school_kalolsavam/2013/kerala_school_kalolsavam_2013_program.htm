      <h3> 53th kerala school kalolsavam 2013 Malappuram logo</h3>
	  <p align="left"> Kerala Now, the historic place of Malappuram entertains 
        the 53rd Kerala State Kalolsavam in which more than 12000 exuberant students 
        with unfathomable calibre will vigorously participate. The Kalolsavam 
        which will be formally inaugurated on 14th January 2013 and concluded 
        on 20th January 2013 will captivate the magnificent participation of enthusiastic 
        public from inside and outside the state of Kerala. The festival is conducted 
        on 17 stages in 7 days in hilarious atmosphere. T W . P. Ubaidulla MLA 
        A. Shajahan IAS Chairman, Gen. Co-ordinator, Organizing Committee Organizing 
        Committee State School Kalolsavam is the biggest arts festival in Asia, 
        organized by the State Government. It gives immense opportunity to expose 
        and develop the multifarious talents of students of secondary and higher 
        secondary levels. Also it provides the general public with unforgettable 
        moments to witness and enjoy the most outstanding artistic treat of the 
        rarest sort.</p>
	  <div align="left">Kerala, God's own country is also a country of diverse 
        festivals. Kerala School Kalolsavam is a festival unique in its structure 
        and organisation. The organisational set up from school level to state 
        level for the conduct of the Kalolsavam is monitored by Education Department 
        as per the manual drafted by experts in the field. Looking back into the 
        history of School Kalolsavam in the last 51 years it is seen that the 
        Kalolsavam has refined much in letter and spirit. Students get opportunity 
        to express their talent in school level, sub district level, district 
        level and at last at state level. When performers reach state level, perfection 
        reaches its zenith. In 1956-57 when the school Kalolsavam began, it had'nt 
        reached any where near the variety, pomp and the vast canvas which the 
        festival has now reached. Dr.C.S.Venkiteswaran was the DPI in 1956. He 
        had the opportunity to participate in the Inter-University festival at 
        Delhi during that time. This inspired the great visionary to organize 
        a similar festival at school level and thus he sowed the seed of School 
        Kalolsavam at Ernakulam SRV High School in 1956. Programme was scheduled 
        for one day and there were 200 participants. Mid-day meal and tea was 
        served. Participation was directly from school level. Year by year more 
        and more items were included, and number of days of the Kalolsavam was 
        increased. Number of participants have increased to ten thousand. From 
        1956-1957 to 2008-2009 School Kalolsavam has crossed many mile stones. 
        Now Govt. has active involvement with peoples representatives from Grama 
        Panchayath level to Corporation Level, Member of Legislative Assembly 
        to Members of Parliament, Ministers etc. giving all support for the success 
        of the Kalolsavam. While in 1956-57 there were only 200 participants, 
        in 2008-2009 there are nearly 10,000 participants. While in 1956-57, it 
        was a business of one day, today it is a festival of 7 days. The decorative 
        main stage accommodates thousands of people. Delicious food is prepared 
        for breakfast, mid day meals & supper for nearly ten thousand participants. 
        The year 1975, when the festival was hosted at Calicut, was a turning 
        point in the history of School Kalolsavam. Many art forms of Kerala tradition 
        like Kathakali music, Mohiniyattom, Aksharaslokam etc. got entry to Kalolsavam 
        for the first time. As a prelude to the Kalolsavam, proclamation rally 
        was organised in 1975. Later on Margomkali, Kuchipudi, Yakshaganam, Band 
        display etc. got entry to the Kalolsavam. By the end of eighties, ever 
        rolling Golden Cup of 117.5 sovereign gold was awarded to the overall 
        winning Revenue District. This Gold Cup was designed by Chirayankeezhu 
        Srikandan Nair who was an Art Instructor in Education Department. In the 
        year 2000, Millenium trophy a beautiful dancing Nataraja trophy was introduced. 
        Today there are numerous trophies, cash prizes, grace marks etc to the 
        winners. The system of Kalathilakam & Kalaprathiba was dispensed with 
        to eliminate unhealthy competition. The festival has a foolproof system 
        to encourage thousands of students in various Art & Literary forms in 
        each academic year. Perfect time management, impartial Judgement, on the 
        spot arrangements to dispose of appeals etc. makes the art festival unique 
        in all aspects. From 2008-2009 it becomes a festival of students from 
        Std.VIII to Plus 2 level. In a Nut Shell, School Kalolsavam is a Kaleidoscope 
        of Kerala's young talent in the field of Art and Literature. Each year 
        the venue of the Kalolsavam is changed from one District to another to 
        ensure the participation of the people through out the state. </div>
