<h2>Understand</h2>

      
<p>Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic Islands, is the largest city in Mallorca. The population of Palma municipality was approximately 400,000 at the beginning of 2007. Half the population of Mallorca lives in the city of Palma.

The city occupies the northwestern end of a bay in the southwest of the island of Mallorca. The city council also has jurisdiction over the sub-archipelago of Cabrera including the islands of Cabrera, Conejera, Estells, Imperial, Rodon, Foradada, Plana, and Pobra.
The name Palma dates back to the Roman settlement on the site of the present city, although the area was originally settled during the Bronze Age. In the early middle ages it was conquered by Arabs, who named it Madina Mayurqa. In 1229 it was conquered by King Jaime I, ruler of Valencia and Aragon, and became an important trade city. Palma saw its dark ages in the 16th century, when a significant decline was caused by attacks from Turkish and Berber Pirates and through plague. Lasting until the 18th century, Felipe V changed the government which made Palma the capital of the Balearic Islands. Later, Carlos III established a free trade pact with the Indies, which had a huge impact turning financials around in Palma.
The city became a tourist destination in the 1950s, and tourist numbers have continually increased in the subsequent half century. Palma is a busy commercial and cultural center of Mallorca. This independent region of the Balearic Islands of Spain has over half of the island’s population.
The holiday season lasts from the end of April until October. Temperatures range from 20–28 °C (68–82 °F) and may require a jacket in the evenings.
Palma de Mallorca, during the 19th century, more sea traffic would come in bringing in much economic growth for the island. Today, Mallorca is one of Europe’s major holiday destinations, with many tourists coming from everywhere, every year. Palma is a city of modern, hotel chains, and flashy shops, yet, is dated and still retains much of the old architecture, with the Old Town having narrow streets, and showing the restored cathedral standing proud in the center of town.

<p> By plane
1 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI IATA) (9 km (5.6 mi) from the centre of Palma). is the major airport in Mallorca, and has daily flights from many European cities on national and budget carriers.   edit
EMT's Line 1 bus service runs between the seaport, the city centre and the airport every fifteen minutes between 6:15am and 2:30am. As of October 2016, the fare is €5.

A taxi ride from the airport to the city centre costs €20-25 and takes maximum 15 minutes without traffic.

Modules
There are four modules at the airport: Module A, Module B, Module C and Module D.

Module A
Located in the north of the airport, it has 28 gates, of which 8 have air bridges. This is the only module that has double air bridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building is closed during winter months and is only used in the summer.

Module B
The smallest Module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have air bridges. It is used by regional aircraft of Air Nostrum, mainly operating intra-Balearic flights.

Module C

Outside view of the airport
The largest of the modules is located in the east. It has 33 gates, of which 9 have air bridges. It is used by Condor and by EasyJet flights to Schengen destinations.

The southern area of the module was worked on and reopened in May 2011.

Module C is also the meeting point for transfers, taxi pickup and groups.

Module D
Located in the south, it has 19 gates of which 10 have air bridges. All odd-numbered gates have a bus transfer.

By train
TIB runs train services between Mallorcan towns. There is no train service to the airport. The main train, bus, and metro station ('Estacio Intermodal') is underground, at Plaça d'Espanya in Palma.
2 Ferrocarril de Soller. operates the quaint wooden electric train from Plaça d'Espanya in Palma to Soller town, northwest of the island, and from where you can continue your relaxing scenic journey to Puerto Soller on the companion Electric Tram. (updated Dec 2017 | edit)

Ferrocarril Soller in Palma de Mallorca
By car
There are no bridges or any road links from/to mainland Spain or other islands. Most cities and towns in Mallorca have road links directly to Palma.

There are several companies in Mallorca that offer transfer facilities from the airport to any destination on the island. Balearic transfer services, Fleet and Goo and BookTaxiMallorca are examples of these companies.

By bus
EMT [1] (ph. 971 43 10 24) runs the local bus service in Palma. Regional buses to destinations around the island are operated mainly by TIB (Transport de les Iles Balears [2] ). All EMT buses are equipped with onboard screens and loudspeakers that state the current and next stop, in both Spanish and Catalán.

EMT's line number 1 will take you from the airport through Palma downtown and to the outer dock of the main harbor (where most large cruise ships dock). Arrivals/departures every 15 minutes from 7AM until 8PM. They operate once every 30 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is €5 (as of October 2016). There is only one fare, so you don't need to specify your destination to the driver/conductor. All other local EMT destinations within Palma cost €1.50(?) so you must tell the driver "no aeroporto, por favor.".

In an effort to reduce drunk driving and get less people driving on the weekends, Palma offers a ´bus de nit´ bus service (Catalán: ´night bus´). It is full of locals and Spaniards from the peninsula and runs from 10PM to 6AM every 20 to 30 minutes, all night. The bus costs €1(?) and goes all the way down the infamous ´Paseo Maritimo´, which is where all the best clubs are in Palma.

By sea

Any number of cruise ships berth at Palma, and there are also a number of ferry services to other Balaeric Islands and to the Iberian peninsula:

Baleària, ☎ +34 966 42 87 00. run ferries from Denia, Valencia, and Ibiza. edit
Alquiler de yates en Mallorca, ☎ +34 620269020 (mobile). Denia, Valencia , and Ibiza. edit
Acconia Trasmediterranea, ☎ +34 902 45 46 45 (non-geographic number). run ferries from Barcelona, Valencia, Ibiza and Mahon. edit
Iscomar Ferries, ☎ +34 971 43 75 00. run ferries from Barcelona, Valencia, Ibiza and Denia. edit
The all-year-around Baleària and Acconia Trasmediterranea ships travel to and from the mainland (Barcelona) once a day, each. They both usually leave Barcelona at night (23:00) and arrive in Palma very early the next day (06:00). And they both usually leave Palma for Barcelona at 12:30 and arrive at 19:30.

Palma's port has a small office on the west end of the port where customers must check in at least one hour before departure. The line can grow long so travelers may want to arrive a couple hours in advance. Please be aware that the ship may depart from the east end of the port, and that a bus will transport the customers from the check in building to the ship. </p>

The tickets are €15 adults and €6,50 children for one day (24 Hours) which is much higher than the other city buses, but they are valid for reboarding as many times as you like within 24 hours, and this is the only bus route that visits the Castell de Bellver.
